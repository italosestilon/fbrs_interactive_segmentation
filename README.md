> **Abstract:** *Deep neural networks have become a mainstream approach to interactive segmentation. As we show in our experiments, while for some images a trained network provides accurate segmentation result with just a few clicks, for some unknown objects it cannot achieve satisfactory result even with a large amount of user input. Recently proposed backpropagating refinement (BRS) scheme introduces an optimization problem for interactive segmentation that results in significantly better performance for the hard cases. At the same time, BRS requires running forward and backward pass through a deep network several times that leads to significantly increased computational budget per click compared to other methods. We propose f-BRS (feature backpropagating refinement scheme) that solves an optimization problem with respect to auxiliary variables instead of the network inputs, and requires running forward and backward pass just for a small part of a network. Experiments on GrabCut, Berkeley, DAVIS and SBD datasets set new state-of-the-art at an order of magnitude lower time per click compared to original BRS.*

### Setting up an environment

This framework is built using Python 3.6 and relies on the recent version of MXNet. The easiest way to install MXNet
is through pip. The following command installs all necessary packages:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also use our [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) to build a container with configured environment. 

If you want to run training or testing, you must configure the paths to the datasets in [config.yml](config.yml) (SBD for training and testing, GrabCut, Berkeley, DAVIS for testing only).

### Interactive Segmentation Demo

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/demo_gui.png" alt="drawing" width="99%"/>
</p>

The GUI is based on TkInter library and it's Python bindings. The following command runs the application (other options are displayed using '-h'):

```
python3 demo.py --checkpoint=<realtive to cfg.INTERACTIVE_MODELS_PATH or absolute path to the checkpoint>
```

You can try an interactive demo with any of provided models (see section [below](#pretrained-models)). Our scripts automatically detect the architecture of the loaded model, just specify the path to the corresponding checkpoint. Examples of the script usage:

```
# This command runs interactive demo with ResNet-34 model from cfg.INTERACTIVE_MODELS_PATH on GPU with id=0
python3 demo.py --checkpoint=resnet34_dh128_sbd --gpu=0

# This command runs interactive demo with ResNet-34 model from /home/demo/fBRS/weights/
python3 demo.py --checkpoint=/home/demo/fBRS/weights/resnet34_dh128_sbd
```

#### Controls:
* press left and right mouse buttons for positive and negative clicks, respectively;
* scroll wheel to zoom in and out;
* hold right mouse button and drag to move around an image (you can also use arrows and WASD);
* press space to finish the current object.

#### Interactive segmentation options:
* ZoomIn (can be turned on/off using the checkbox)
    * *Skip clicks* - the number of clicks to skip before using ZoomIn. 
    * *Target size* - ZoomIn crop is resized so its longer side matches this value (increase for large objects).
    * *Expand ratio* - object bbox is rescaled with this ratio before crop.
* BRS parameters (BRS type can be changed using the dropdown menu)
    * *Network clicks* - the number of first clicks that are included in the network's input. Subsequent clicks are processed only using BRS  (NoBRS ignores this option). 
    * *L-BFGS-B max iterations* - the maximum number of function evaluation for each step of optimization in BRS (increase for better accuracy and longer computational time for each click).  
* Visualisation parameters
    * *Prediction threshold* slider adjusts the threshold for binarization of probability map for the current object. 
    * *Alpha blending coefficient* slider adjusts the intensity of all predicted masks.
    * *Visualisation click radius* slider adjusts the size of red and green dots depicting clicks.

### Datasets

We train all our models on SBD dataset and evaluate them on GrabCut, Berkeley, DAVIS, SBD and COCO_MVal datasets. We additionally provide the results of models that trained on combination of [COCO](http://cocodataset.org) and [LVIS](https://www.lvisdataset.org) datasets.

Berkeley dataset consists of 100 instances (96 unique images) provided by [[K. McGuinness, 2010]][McGuinness2010].
We use the same 345 images from DAVIS dataset for testing as [[WD Jang, 2019]][BRS], ground-truth mask for each image is a union of all objects' masks.
For testing on SBD dataset we evaluate our algorithm on every instance in the test set separately following the protocol of [[WD Jang, 2019]][BRS].

To construct COCO_MVal dataset we sample 800 object instances from the validation set of [COCO 2017](http://cocodataset.org). Specifically, we sample 10 unique instances from each of the 80 categories. The only exception is the toaster object class, which has only 9 unique instances in instances_val2017 annotation. So to get 800 masks one of the classes contains 11 objects. We provide this dataset for downloading so that everyone can reproduce our results.

### Testing

#### Pretrained models
We provide pretrained models with different backbones for interactive segmentation. The evaluation results are different from the ones presented in our paper, because we have retrained all models on the new codebase presented in this repository. We greatly accelerated the inference of the RGB-BRS algorithm - now it works from 2.5 to 4 times faster on SBD dataset compared to the timings given in the paper. Nevertheless, the new results sometimes are even better.

You can find model weights and test results in the tables below:

#### Evaluation script

We provide the script to test all the presented models in all possible configurations on GrabCut, Berkeley, DAVIS, COCO_MVal and SBD datasets. To test a model, you should download its weights and put it in `./weights` folder (you can change this path in the [config.yml](config.yml), see `INTERACTIVE_MODELS_PATH` variable). To test any of our models, just specify the path to the corresponding checkpoint. Our scripts automatically detect the architecture of the loaded model.

The following command runs the model evaluation (other options are displayed using '-h'):

```
python3 scripts/evaluate_model.py <brs-mode> --checkpoint=<checkpoint-name>
```

Examples of the script usage:
```
# This command evaluates ResNet-34 model in f-BRS-B mode on all Datasets.
python3 scripts/evaluate_model.py f-BRS-B --checkpoint=resnet34_dh128_sbd

# This command evaluates ResNet-50 model in RGB-BRS mode on GrabCut and Berkeley datasets.
python3 scripts/evaluate_model.py RGB-BRS --checkpoint=resnet50_dh128_sbd --datasets=GrabCut,Berkeley

# This command evaluates ResNet-101 model in DistMap-BRS mode on DAVIS dataset.
python3 scripts/evaluate_model.py DistMap-BRS --checkpoint=resnet101_dh256_sbd --datasets=DAVIS
```

#### Jupyter notebook

You can also interactively experiment with our models using [test_any_model.ipynb](./notebooks/test_any_model.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.

### Training

We provide the scripts for training our models on SBD dataset. You can start training with the following commands:
```
# ResNet-34 model
python3 train.py models/sbd/r34_dh128.py --gpus=0,1 --workers=4 --exp-name=first-try

# ResNet-50 model
python3 train.py models/sbd/r50_dh128.py --gpus=0,1 --workers=4 --exp-name=first-try

# ResNet-101 model
python3 train.py models/sbd/r101_dh256.py --gpus=0,1,2,3 --workers=6 --exp-name=first-try
```

For each experiment, a separate folder is created in the `./experiments` with Tensorboard logs, text logs, visualization and model's checkpoints. You can specify another path in the [config.yml](config.yml) (see `EXPS_PATH` variable).

Please note that we have trained ResNet-34 and ResNet-50 models on 2 GPUs, ResNet-101 on 4 GPUs (we used Nvidia Tesla P40 for training). If you are going to train models in different GPUs configuration, you will need to set a different batch size. You can specify batch size using the command line argument `--batch-size` or change the default value in model script.
